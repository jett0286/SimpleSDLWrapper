# SimpleSDLWrapper

SimpleSDLWrapper is a set of classes designed to automate some of the more tedious and hard-to-learn parts of SDL. Because of this, **almost all non-essential features are missing**. For example, the only shape a clickable screen area can currently take is a rectangle. The guiding design principle of this library is to make simple SDL projects easy to start.
